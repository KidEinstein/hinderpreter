PREREQUISITES

1. You must have CMake installed (www.cmake.org).
  a) If you're using a Linux distro with package managment CMake should be in
    your repositories.

2. Python 2.7+ or Python 2.x with the argparse module installed.

INSTALLATION: THE EASY WAY ON LINUX OR MAC OSX

1. run the script install.py. Note that

  $ ./install.py -h

  will display a list of relavent install options. For
  example, if I wanted to install hinderpreter to the directory
  "/home/kurtis/opt" I would run:

  $ ./install.py --prefix="/home/kurtis/opt"


INSTALLATION: THE MORE INVOLVED WAY ON LINUX OR MAC OSX

1. Configure hi using CMake. This can be as simple as opening up the terminal,
  navigating to the directory containing hinderpreter and typing:

  $ cmake .

  You can also provide any other argument to the CMake configuration process
  you'd like. To enable Memory testing turn the PERFORM_MEM_TESTS option on
  like so:

  $ cmake -DPERFORM_MEM_TESTS:BOOL=ON .

  You can also use the "ccmake" command or the CMake GUI if you prefer.
  See the cmake documentation for more details.

2. Build the project:

  $ make

3. Install

  $ make install

4. (Optional) Build documentation:

  $ make docs

5. (Optional) Run tests:

  $ ctest

INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS

(Note that the instructions were written from the point of view of Windows 7,
but in practice, any modern version will work.)

1. Add MinGW and Python to your PATH.

  - Start > right-click Computer > Properties > Advanced system settings
    > Environment Variables....

  - Select the "PATH" variable and click "Edit...".

  - Add ";C:\MinGW\bin;C:\Python32" to the end.

3. Open an Administrator shell

  - Start > All Programs > Accessories > right-click Command Prompt
    > Run as administrator.

4. Navigate to the project directory using the "cd" command, for example,

  > cd C:\Users\%user%\Documents\hinderpreter

5. run the script install.py. Note that

  > install.py -h

  will display a list of relavent install options. For
  example, if I wanted to install hinderpreter to the directory
  "C:\Program Files\hinderpreter" I would run:

  > install.py --prefix="C:/Program Files/hinderpreter"

  (notice that forward slashes are used to separate directories.)
